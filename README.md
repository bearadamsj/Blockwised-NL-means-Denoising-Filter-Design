# Blockwised-NL-means-Denoising-Filter-Design
A blockwised Nonlocal means denoiser has been implemented for image denoising.
- very serious issue in medical image processing is to remove the noise without losing any integrity of the original images, that is the image itself does not contort or lose any information due to the denoising process. Another important issue is that we want the algorithm to be executed as fast as possible without any delay, since the real-time surgery has been more widely implemented. This report is written to demonstrate that the newly proposed blockwise Non-local Means Filter can be 3 to 4 times faster in processing speed in 2-D domain and possibly 8 to 9 times faster in 3-D domain.
